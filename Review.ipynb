    "iphone\tRahul Prasad\t5\tFabulous!\tBest smart phone under this price range compare to other phones in 2023 if you see overall build quality, performance and Camera with autofocus and video action mode are awesome50% extra RAM compared to iPhone 13 and other more features. Best time to upgrade to iPhone 14 . I am so happy See Low light photos are amazing..\n",
    "iphone\tSankhadip Mazumder\t4\tGood choice\tIt's a apple device .. that means you get the good old ios . No performance issue , supper ram and power management . My slightly distasteful remark would be on its camera . Dont get me wrong , its great but the colors seems to be vibrant by default which I'm not really a fan of. Also the low light performance of the front camera is not that sharp . I used to own a pixel 3 and its front camera output seems to be better than iphone 13s . But overall the camera is good and it will do the job. ...\n",
    "iphone\tFlipkart Customer\t5\tTerrific\tDamn such a great phone. Camera is really good, battery lasts long enough, super smooth even though its just 60 hz XDR display. Videos with action mode on are insanely stable and crisp.The whole apple environment itself is so seamless. I shifted from android to iPhone and it barely took any time since I had iPad and a mac already. With a just a few clicks the phone was ready to go.\n",
